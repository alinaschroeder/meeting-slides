# Why Developing World Healthcare?

## There's a Need

![](../imgs/hospital_hall.png){width=100%}

## What Does A Developing World Hospital Look Like?

- Inconsistent power grid

- Unreliable utilities (water, gas)

- Overcrowded public hospitals

- Underfunded public health services

- Lack of reliable medical equipment


## Where Does Engineering Come In?

According to Engineering World Health [^1]:

- 95% of medical equipment in these hospitals is donated

- 39% of equipment is broken on arrival

- 98% of equipment is nonfunctional after 5 years

Why do you think this is?

## Design for Constrained Environments

At TEWH, we engineer devices to work in the difficult working environment of
the developing world. This means optimizing:

. . .

- Power consumption / battery life

. . .

- User interface simplicity

. . .

- Cost

## Previous TEWH Design Projects

- Audiometry Made Easy (2014)

    - Android app to measure hearing loss

- FreePulse Patient Monitor (2015)

    - Low-cost vitals monitoring machine

- Sensor Glasses (2016)

    - Navigation assistance to the blind without using a white cane

- Oxygen Concentrator (2016)

    - Low-cost and efficient oxygen concentrator that doesn't use zeolite

- Gluco-App (2016)

    - Android app for tracking blood glucose levels and promoting diabetes
      education and wellness
